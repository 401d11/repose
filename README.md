## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

**_employMee()** primarily uses the Java language with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system and the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework), specifically [SpringMVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html). Initial setup is done with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), selecting the following dependencies:
1. [Andriod Studios](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools)
2. [AWS Cognito](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws)
3. [AWS Amplify](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
4. [AWS S3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
5. [Espresso](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)

**_employMee()** uses the Thymeleaf template engine for dynamic HTML displays and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for elegant styling. Core communication functionality is created using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), specifically the [SendGrid](https://www.twilio.com/sendgrid/email-api) email API and [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/).

The application is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with a remote database linked to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) using the Heroku Postgres add-on and [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) graphical user interface to help manage it.
